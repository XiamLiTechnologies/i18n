Very simple yet powerful internalization (i18n) library for javascript.

## Installation

Just add one of the following scripts to your website:

#### Not minified
```html
<script src="https://cdn.xiamli.com/i18n-1.2.0.js" integrity="sha384-7G7CDQp8QwWz4ojzoMH/mCbo7Mox/KW9VB86YH8xlJYcwHrHuf9E4Crxk8Z5dx9t" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/XiamLiTechnologies/i18n/4f6909ca44ec2ed247e882eb53be92504d7c2abb/i18n.js" integrity="sha384-7G7CDQp8QwWz4ojzoMH/mCbo7Mox/KW9VB86YH8xlJYcwHrHuf9E4Crxk8Z5dx9t" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

#### Minified
```html
<script src="https://cdn.xiamli.com/i18n-1.2.0.min.js" integrity="sha384-r4RLiw0da8QqcoAaaPrJMpSor/HKKq2HCBGsat8FWYPVXYSlKteZuaqBjs5iytv1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## Usage
After adding the script to your website you're ready to go.
Just go and translate some stuff, for example:

Change this:

```html
<h2>Hello</h2>
```

to this:

```html
<h2 i18n="hello"></h2>
```

And add the corresponding language files to "i18n/":

i18n/en.js:
```json
{
  "hello": "Hello"
}
```

i18n/de.js:
```json
{
  "hello": "Hallo"
}
```

i18n/es.js:
```json
{
  "hello": "Hola"
}
```
  
If you don't set a language (for example via a language switcher or something like that) it'll try to use the language of the user's browser and if this doesn't exist it'll fallback to english.

So if you're coming from spain and therefore your browsers language is espanol, you would be displayed:

```html
<h2>Hola<h2>
```
